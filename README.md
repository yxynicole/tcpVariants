# tcpVariants
Performance Analysis of TCP Variants 
## Xinyu todo:
- [x] to paramertize the running of our TCL file so we can pass in on the command line things like the TCP variant, cbr bandwidth.  
- [ ] the random number aspect so the flows start at different times
- [x] TCL file for experiment 2
- [x] TCL file for experiment 3 

## Jeff todo:
- [ ] review trace file analysis code to calculate drops, average bandwith, and round trip time for experiment 1
- [ ] review experiment 2 and 3 and determine what tweaks to will be need to tracefile analysis code
- [ ] time series plot of TCP to confirm it is conforming to expected pattern

## Not assigned yet todo:
- [ ] script to kickoff analysis of relevant files and to determine average across all simulations
- [ ] writing of actual paper sections
